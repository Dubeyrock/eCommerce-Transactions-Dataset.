# eCommerce-Transactions-Dataset.
Analysis of eCommerce transactions including EDA, lookalike model for customer recommendations, and customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Contains code, reports, and model outputs.

### Project Description:

This project focuses on analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset consisting of customer, product, and transaction details. The tasks include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform a comprehensive analysis to understand the dataset's structure, detect patterns, and derive actionable business insights.
   
2. **Lookalike Model**: Develop a model that recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model assigns a similarity score for each recommendation to suggest the top 3 lookalike customers for the first 20 customers in the dataset.

3. **Customer Segmentation**: Implement clustering techniques to segment customers based on their profiles and transaction behavior. The project evaluates clustering quality using the DB Index and visualizes the results.

The deliverables include detailed reports, Jupyter notebooks, and the final model outputs, which can be used to improve customer targeting, marketing strategies, and product recommendations for an eCommerce business.
